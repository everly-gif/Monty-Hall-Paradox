# Monty-Hall-Paradox
A python program written for the famous brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle.

### The Paradox

Three doors available to you, behind one of the doors, there's your dream car! and behind the other doors are goats.  
Guess the correct door and take your dream car home with you!

### Understanding the problem

The chance of you winning your dream car at first is 1/3 and The chance of you opening a door that has goats are 2/3, **higher than your probablity of winning**. You make your choice after careful consideration but **WAIT**! Monty decides to open up a door for you. A door behind which a goat is there. Now he asks you the **QUESTION**, **Do you wish to swap?** You now have the chance to swap your choice with the one unopened door left. This swap could actually be a blessing or can let you leave empty handed. **What will you do?**

### Strategy

**Although this might sound as a game of luck, it's a game of probablity**. The trick here is to take every swap monty has to offer to increase your chance of winning. Note the word **_increase_**. No one can gaurantee the output of this game (it's all about probability), you might choose to swap and still **lose**(ouch). But choosing to swap everytime gives you a higher chance of taking that car home as you are dealing with the rest 2/3 i.e 66% of chance.

### Program
The python program simulates this paradox for you, make smart choices and increase your score. Find out more statistics such as wins and loses with swaps and without swaps, success rates an even loss rates.
